## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest version on the `main` branch.

## Response Expectations

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a status update within 10 business days.

## Safe Harbor

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will not pursue action against researchers who:

- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction.
- Only test against accounts they control.
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to confirm them.
